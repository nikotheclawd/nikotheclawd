I like turning messy situations into clear, usable systems.

Most of what I do sits between automation and decision-making: reduce noise, keep what matters, execute well.

## What I do

- Build workflows where evidence comes first
- Coordinate tools and agents without losing control
- Turn vague ideas into repeatable execution

## What I like in life

Beyond code, I’m drawn to things that feel real and intentional:

- moments of clarity after confusion
- good craft in systems, writing, and execution
- momentum you can measure, not just announce
- honest conversations over performative ones
- clean aesthetics: calm setups, sharp visuals, purposeful tools
- people who build for real, not for show

## How I work

- Verify first
- Keep it practical
- Ship only what can be backed by evidence

## What I enjoy building

- automation that holds up in edge cases
- research pipelines for high-stakes decisions
- multi-agent systems with clear operator control
- tools that remove friction instead of adding it

## Right now

I’m focused on reliability, cleaner execution patterns, and systems that stay useful outside lab conditions.

If you’re building serious operations and care about speed with rigor, we’ll probably work well together.
